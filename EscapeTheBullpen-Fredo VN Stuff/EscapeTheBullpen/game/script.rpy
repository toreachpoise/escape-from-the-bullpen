"Your heart drops somewhere into the sloshing mass of your middle."
"Another bull visit? But it's been less than a month. You haven't even had your period since the last one."
"Oh ... oh no ..."

extend "... Maybe you're pregnant."
show jack depressed
"That's what the bulls want, or rather, what the system as a whole wants. That's why the bulls visit you every month."
"Once a month they come to force themselves on you, your fate for being one of the rare humans remaining who is able to get pregnant."

j "I mean, maybe being raped will cause me to miscarry?"
"Unlikely."
show jack depressed
extend "It's much more likely that the bull will notice and demand that you be taken back to the facility where they keep all the other cows ..."
"You'll be taken, sedated until you give birth, and kept and raped over and over again for having been unlucky enough to prove your fertility."
"You managed to escape from the facility only a couple of years ago, having almost aged out of being a cow, and being too trans and ugly to be prized by the bulls."
"These monthly visits were the doctors' compromise--you could be free, but only a little bit. They would still extract what they needed from you."
